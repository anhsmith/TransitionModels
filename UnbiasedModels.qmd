Model 1: Bayesian Logistic Regression

The model assumes a logistic regression framework where the probability of class 1, denoted as $( P(y=1 \mid X) )$, is modeled using a sigmoid function. The log-odds of $(P(y=1 \mid X))$ is modeled as a linear function of the predictor variable $X$, and the model parameters are estimated using Bayesian inference techniques.

$$
\text{logit}(P(y=1 \mid X)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X
$$

Model 2: Bayesian Generative Model with Transition Point

The model introduces a transition point, denoted as $\mu$, which represents the value of $X$ at which the transition from class 0 to class 1 occurs. As $X$ increases, the probability of transitioning from class 0 to class 1 increases. The model assumes a probit link function, where the probability of class 1, $(P(y=1 \mid X))$, is modeled using a cumulative normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.

$$
P(y=1 \mid X) = \Phi\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)
$$

Model 3: Generative Model with Quantiles and Transition Point

The model extends the previous model by incorporating quantiles and the restriction that the probability of class 0 $(P(y=0 \mid X))$ is equal to 1 minus the probability of class 1 $(P(y=1 \mid X))$. The transition point $\mu$ represents the value of $X$ at which the probabilities of class 0 and class 1 are equal. The model assumes a cumulative probit function for class 1 and calculates the probability of class 0 as $(1 - \Phi\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right))$.

$$
P(y=1 \mid X) = \Phi\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right), \quad P(y=0 \mid X) = 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)
$$

Model 4: Generative Model with Quantiles and Complementarity

The model builds on the previous model by directly modeling the quantiles of class 1 and class 0, with the restriction that one is the complement of the other. The model assumes a cumulative normal distribution for class 0 and calculates the probability of class 1 as $1 - \Phi\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)$.

$$
P(y=1 \mid X) = 1 - \Phi\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right), \quad P(y=0 \mid X) = \Phi\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\right)
$$

Model 5: Generative Model with Transition Point and Sensitivity to Imbalance

The model extends the previous model by incorporating a sensitivity to unbalanced samples of class 0 and class 1. The log-sum-exp function is used to calculate the likelihood, which combines the probabilities of transitioning from class 0 to class 1 and from class 1 to class 0, weighted by the quantile parameter $\theta$. This formulation ensures that the model assigns equal importance to both transitions and is not biased towards either class. The transition point $\mu$ represents the location of the transition along the predictor variable $X$.

$$
\text{log-sum-exp} ( \log(1-\theta) + \text{normallcdf}(0 | \eta[i], 1), \log(\theta) + \text{normallccdf}(0 | \eta[i], 1) )
$$

In this line, we use the log-sum-exp function to compute the log-likelihood contribution for each data point. The log-likelihood is calculated based on the probabilities of transitioning from class 0 to class 1 and from class 1 to class 0, weighted by the quantile parameter $\theta$. We use the $\eta [i]$ parameter, which represents the linear predictor for each observation, given by $\eta [i] = \frac{X[i] - \mu}{\sigma}$.

The log-sum-exp function combines the logarithms of the two terms: $\log(1 - \theta) + \text{normallcdf}(0 \mid \eta [i], 1)$ and $\log(\theta) + \text{normallccdf}(0 | \eta[i], 1)$. 

The $\text{normallcdf}(0 | \eta[i], 1)$ function calculates the log of the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal distribution at $\eta[i]$, while $\text{normallccdf}(0 | \eta[i], 1)$ calculates the log of the complementary cumulative distribution function.

This formulation ensures that the model assigns equal importance to both transitions (from class 0 to class 1 and from class 1 to class 0) and is not biased towards either class.
